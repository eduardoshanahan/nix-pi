# 2026-01-19

- Renamed host naming scheme from `pi-N` to `rpi-box-NN` across flake, hosts, and docs.
- Added `documentation/ip-addresses.md` and updated `documentation/DEPLOYMENT.md` examples to match current IP assignments.
- Added `modules/hardware/rpi-3.nix` and `modules/hardware/rpi-4.nix`, wired per-host (`rpi-box-03` is Pi 3; `rpi-box-01`/`rpi-box-02` are Pi 4).
- Removed `rpi-box-04` for now and added `rpi-box-01-sd` as the Pi 4 SD image build target.
- Added runbooks under `documentation/runbooks/` and introduced `documentation/adr/ADR-0002-fleet-operations-documentation.md` to formalize operations documentation.
- Prepared the repo for public GitHub by moving SSH authorized keys and LAN IP mapping to gitignored local files (`local/authorized-keys.nix` and `documentation/ip-addresses.local.md`), removing environment-specific values from tracked configs/docs.
