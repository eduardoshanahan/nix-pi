# Response Style (Pointer)

Canonical source of truth for assistant response style lives in:

- `nix-services/response_style.md`

This file is intentionally pointer-only to avoid style drift between repositories.

## Local Rule

When working in `nix-pi`, apply the canonical response style above unless a task explicitly requires a different style.
