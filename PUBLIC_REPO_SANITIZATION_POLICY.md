# Public Repo Sanitization Policy (Pointer)

Canonical source of truth for this policy lives in:

- `nix-services/PUBLIC_REPO_SANITIZATION_POLICY.md`

This file is intentionally pointer-only to avoid drift between repositories.

## Local Rule

Before commit/push from `nix-pi`, apply the canonical sanitization policy above.

If a `nix-pi`-specific exception is ever needed, document only that exception here and keep the base policy in `nix-services`.
